**Q: Why is there no mention of teams or team structure in the SMPL Guide?**
A: First, SMPL doesn't apply to just teams. It's a fully scalable framework. An individual working on an idea could implement SMPL just as well as a large group or a team of teams.

Second, SMPL puts the accountability first and the responsibility for adapting to form the best work flow possible on those involved. Furthermore, edicting a team size based on a theory that was derived from a study that was conducted in the 1950s is a fundamental violation of the empirical nature of SMPL. A SMPL model must be crafted by the inidividuals involved for it to be empirically representative of their capabilities at the present time. And while these individuals could elect to leverage prior work of others to setup their attempts, SMPL doesn't strongly discourage such practices, instead SMPL strongly advocates that the model be adapted to match the actual vision and the capabilities of those currently involved. 

Ultimately, until the participants in a SMPL model produce a return on their investment, the evidence that the structure under which the idea is being transformed remains pending validation. SMPL is intrinsically designed to address leadership and therefore, places the accountability of identifying and calibrating the optimal working structure, onto the participants as part of their attempts as opposed to leaving this part to a later stage or an auxiliary process.

**Q: I see the word investment mentioned a lot! Is SMPL all about money and profits?**
A: SMPL places people over process in every regard. This is key in the concept of investing because the currency for measuring a return on time, energy and resources invested by an individual or a group of collaborators is a matter of agreement among those involved and impacted. What SMPL does stress is that the individual(s) accepting the accountabilities define their currency early on and revisit its definition continuously to ensure that it is still relevant and indicative. In some cases, actual dollars and cents will be the currency to measure the return, while in others, audience size, or trees saved.

The investment accountability in the SMPL framework acknowledges that a virtuous economic arrangement among the accountables and the impacted is a key component for reaching a sustained model.

------------

**Q: Why doesn't SMPL discuss who are the authors or thought leaders behind it?**
A: SMPL as a framework must stand on its own merits and not on the accomplishments of its collaborators.

------------

**Q: Why another framework? Ins't there a saturation of frameworks out there already?**
A: SMPL is a modern framework that is based on observations and principals that were derived specifically to address the common pitfalls and challenges that have plagued organizations and teams that have tried to pursue Agile and found it preplexing.

------------

**Q: Why is there no fixed cycle in SMPL? Isn't sprinting good? How do you measure over time if the cycle time is variable?**
A: SMPL doesn't prescribe a cycle time but that's not to say that a sustained model shouldn't have one. SMPL puts the owness of defining the most optimal cycle time onto the accountables. Through empiricism and interactions, participants in a SMPL model, should discover their optimal productivity cycle then aim to reinforce it so that it becomes sustained. 

SMPL recognizes that every effort made to produce the desired vision is an attempt. The act of discovering this sustained productivity cycle may require one or more attempts to reach.

Furthermore, the attempt should be the shortest period of time possible to produce a candidate that realizes the vision at quality. For some domains that duration could be achieved in a matter of seconds or minutes and while other domains require days or weeks. Imposing a minimum of 1 week or a maximum of 4 weeks is arbitrary and synthetic. And while it may appear to fit many workloads, the reality is that such practice is one of the contributors to cargo culting, and for all these reasons, SMPL edicts that imperical evidence is used to define each model's cycle time. 

Lastly, SMPL does encourage that the optimal cycle be continous. The information and events that drive productivity and engagement may not always be up to us to schedule. Sustained models

**Q: Where is the product backlog? What about the sprint backlog? Don't we need a sprint backlog?**
A: SMPL is founded on the principle of vision, transformation, and adaptation. These are the pillars of SMPL. The model's Value Flow accountables are empowered to combine the tools that they see as "best fit" for the outcomes that they're supporting with the vision, transformation, and adaptation activities. The emphasis should be less on the tools that are used to achieve the vision and more on the outcome. To that end, if an individual or a group that is working on a SMPL model feels that they need a force ranked backlog to interact and communicate priorities, then incorporating any one of the many tools that are available out there should suffice. At no point should a SMPL model give the tools that they rely on priority over the people who are using said tools. The accountabilities don't go away as a result of the tools for example.

Lastly, tools are typically accelerators. Think of driving a nail without a hammer vs with one or digging a hole without a shovel vs with one. If at any point, the use of a tool has the revese effect on a team, then it is imperative on the participants in such a model to remove these tools out of the way of their progress and replace them with alternatives that accelerate their approach to a materialized vision.

**Q: I am a certified Scrum Master, what would my role be under SMPL?**
A: SMPL mandates that a single point of accountability for value flow per model is established. Value flow however is a shared team responsibility; whereas Scrum places the burden of optimizing the process onto the shoulders of the Scrum Master. All the participants of a SMPL model play a role and have a responsibility to maximize the efficiency of the flow. Furthermore, since SMPL can be scaled down to 1 single individual, in the case of one person working on an idea, the 4 SMPL areas of accountability, in a single player scenario, are then concentrated into that individual.

To be crystal clear, SMPL permits for one individual to wear multiple accountability hats so to speak; however, no single accountability can be shared by two or more individuals. This is an important distinction as the accountables in a SMPL model, are encouraged to scale their responsibilities; however, they must do so without compromise to their accountability. This strong relationship that SMPL places on the individuals accepting accountability and the vision itself that they're adopting is a prime example of how the servant leader mentality is organically woven into the SMPL fabric. Those responsible aren't subordinates to the accountables, but rather understand that the role they're playing is a supporting role.

Individuals are encouraged to step up and adopt an accountability in a SMPL model. Accountabilities cannot be assigned. Accountables can be nominated, but acceptance of the accountability by the nominee(s) is a key part of the establishment of vision.

**Q: I am a Certified Scrum Product Owner, what would my role be under SMPL?**
A: SMPL mandates that a single point of accountability for investment per model is established. Investment however is a shared team responsibility; whereas, Scrum combines the Investment, Usefulness and Relevancy into the role of the product owner. SMPL views these accountabilities as components and could be concentrated or distributed. SMPL does not create artificial boundaries by limiting the jurisdiction or implying a limit to the jurisdiction of the participants in a SMPL implementation.

**Q: I am a certified SAFe Agilist, Scaled Program Consultant, Practitioner, Scrum Master, Advanced Srum Master, Release Train Engineer, Product Owner, DevOps Practitioner, Government Practitioner, Agile Software Engineer, Architect or any SAFe certification known as of the time of reading this question. What is my role under SMPL?**
A: SMPL is a framework. It is not a recipe. It is not a process nor is it a methodology. SMPL empowers its participants to determine the skills and knowledge that they need to succeed. It mandates that empirical evidence is used to determine these skills. In turn, the participants can align with one of the four areas of accountability that SMPL recognizes. Quality under SMPL is an infinite pursuite and the idea that one or a group of individuals could define for the rest of the world a one size fits all template for quality is absurd. Each model is unique to a certain degree similar to how each fingerprint is unique. SMPL places the trust on figuring out the necessary skills to take accountability for quality with confidence into the participants of the model.

**Q: I am interested in implementing SMPL. Are there professional service providers offering SMPL advisory that can help me with my SMPL implementation?**
A: SMPLAgile.org is working on establishing partnerships. At this time, we advise you to read the guide and use the discussion area on this site to ask any questions you may have.

**Q: You talk about visions as needing to be composable and decomposable. What do you mean by that?**
A: The simplest way to explain this concept is to think about the difference between a puzzle and a mosaic. A puzzle cannot be enjoyed or more directly is plain unusable until it's completed or fully composed. By contrast, a mosaic is a collection of visuals that individually, could stand on their own and represent something, all the while, representing something bigger and more powerful when combined together. SMPL is an infinitely scalable framework and for that to be true, its components must also scale infinitely.
